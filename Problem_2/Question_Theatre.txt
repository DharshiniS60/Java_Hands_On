Create a class Theatre with the below attributes:
theatreId – int
theatreName – String
seatCapacity – int
ticketRate – double
theatreRating – int
The above attributes should be private. Write getters, setters, and parameterized constructor as required. Create class Solution with main method.
Implement two static methods - findTheatreCategory and findSecondHighestTicket in Solution class.
findTheatreCategory method:
This method will take two input parameters: array of Theatre objects and an int value.
The method will find out the category of theatre for the given theatreId (the int parameter passed).
The method will return "Premium" as category if the seatCapacity of theatre is greater than 1000 and theatreRating is greater than or equal to 4.
The method will return "Non Premium" as category if the theatre is found but does not meet premium criteria.
If no Theatre with the given theatreId is present in the array, then the method should return null.
findSecondHighestTicket method:
This method will take an array of Theatre objects as input parameter.
The method will return the Theatre object with second highest ticketRate if and only if the theatreRating is greater than or equal to 2.
Otherwise, the method should return null.
Note: theatreId is unique.
No two Theatre objects would have same ticketRate and theatreRating.
The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.
For findTheatreCategory method – The main method should print the category as "Premium" or "Non Premium" based on the calculation, if the returned value is not null.
If the returned value is null, then it should print "There is no Theatre with the given theatreId".
For findSecondHighestTicket method – The main method should print the theatreName from returned Theatre object if the returned value is not null.
If the returned value is null then it should print "No valid theatres are available".
Before calling static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Theatre objects referring attributes in the above attribute sequence.
Next, read an int parameter for capturing theatreId to search.
